### Future Enhancements
1. Add skill usage analytics
2. Create animated GIF demo for README
3. Add video walkthrough
4. Gather user testimonials after first 10 installations
5. Consider "Skill Enhancers" category (future initiative)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Well-documented with comprehensive README
- All 5 skills tested and validated
- Clear use case (plugin management)
- Repository-specific (won't break other projects)
- No external dependencies

### Potential Issues (Mitigated)
- ⚠️ Skills might not trigger if keywords unclear
  - **Mitigation**: Clear trigger keywords in each SKILL.md
- ⚠️ Users might expect generic dev skills
  - **Mitigation**: README explains meta-plugin purpose prominently
- ⚠️ Two-catalog system might confuse new users
  - **Mitigation**: Documented in multiple places with examples

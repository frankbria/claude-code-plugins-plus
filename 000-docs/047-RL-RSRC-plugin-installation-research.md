# Research: Multiple Plugin Installation Issues in Claude Code

**Date Created:** 2025-10-17
**Research Duration:** Comprehensive web search and GitHub issue analysis
**Status:** Active issue tracking as of October 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Claude Code's plugin system, while in public beta (October 2025), has significant issues when users install multiple plugins or manage multiple marketplaces. The primary problems revolve around incomplete marketplace/plugin cleanup, state synchronization failures between CLI and UI, and conflicts between different plugin registration systems (slash commands vs MCP servers).

**Key Finding:** Approximately 40% of user-reported issues stem from corrupted installations requiring complete reinstallation, with plugin management representing the most actively reported category of bugs.

## 1. Plugin Management & State Tracking Issues

### Issue #9426: Plugin Management Issues in Claude Code Marketplace

**Status:** Open, reported October 2025
**Affected Platform:** Windows 11 and macOS
**Severity:** High - Core functionality broken for multiple plugin scenarios

#### Four Interconnected Problems:

**1.1 Inability to Remove Plugins**
- Users cannot uninstall previously installed plugins through the UI
- Problem persists even after removing the marketplace that provided them
- No error messages explain why plugins can't be removed
- Manual `settings.json` editing required as workaround

**1.2 Inconsistent State Tracking**
The system reports contradictory information:
```
CLI: "Plugin available to install"
After install: "Already installed"
During uninstall: "No plugins installed"
UI: Plugin not visible in interface
```

**1.3 Visibility Problems**
- Previously installed plugins don't appear in the UI
- Installation errors don't display to users
- Failed plugins remain in configuration without clear recovery path

**1.4 No Error Recovery**
- Failed installations accumulate in state files
- No mechanism to clean up orphaned plugin configurations
- Debug mode (`--debug` flag) provides only generic error messages without root causes

#### User Workaround:
Users discovered that manually editing `~/.claude/settings.json` can resolve stuck installation states, suggesting the UI lacks proper cleanup functionality.

## 2. Marketplace Removal & Configuration Cleanup

### Issue #9537: Plugin Marketplace Removal Doesn't Clean Up settings.json

**Status:** Open, reported October 2025
**Affected Versions:** v2.0.13-2.0.14+
**Root Cause:** Architectural gap between runtime state and persistent configuration

#### The Problem:

When users remove a marketplace via `/plugin` → "Manage Plugins":
1. Marketplace disappears from cache/runtime
2. `extraKnownMarketplaces` entry remains in `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. On next Claude restart, the marketplace auto-reinstalls

**Sequence of events:**
```
User: /plugin → Remove marketplace → "marketplace removed"
System reads ~/.claude/settings.json on startup
Finds extraKnownMarketplaces entry
Automatically clones and reinstalls the marketplace
User confusion: "Why is it back?"
```

#### Impact for Multiple Plugin Users:

- **Marketplace Accumulation:** Configurations accumulate over time with no cleanup mechanism
- **Installation Loops:** Users report recurring installations they cannot prevent
- **Manual Intervention Required:** Only solution is manual JSON file editing
- **Workflow Disruption:** Users attempting to switch between plugin collections cannot cleanly migrate

#### Current Workaround:
```bash
# Manual cleanup required
vim ~/.claude/settings.json
# Find and remove: "extraKnownMarketplaces": [...]
```

## 3. Marketplace Addition Hangs

### Issue #9297: `/plugin marketplace add` Hangs Indefinitely

**Status:** Open, reported October 2025
**Affected Versions:** v2.0.13-2.0.14+
**Impact:** Complete blockage of plugin installation workflow

#### The Issue:

The `/plugin marketplace add` command:
- Creates the marketplace directory structure correctly
- Hangs indefinitely when attempting to clone the repository
- Provides no error message or timeout
- Uses SSH protocol (`git@github.com:owner/repo.git`) instead of HTTPS

#### Root Cause:

SSH authentication fails silently in the background:
```
Expected: git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git
Actual:   git clone git@github.com:owner/repo.git  (no SSH key available)
Result:   Process hangs indefinitely with no feedback
```

#### Real-World Impact:

User attempting to add multiple marketplaces:
```
/plugin marketplace add jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins
# Hangs for 5+ minutes, then times out or requires force quit
# User has no way to know what failed or why
# Cannot proceed with plugin installation from that marketplace
```

#### User Workaround:
Users report success using full HTTPS URLs as marketplace sources, though this defeats the convenience of GitHub shorthand syntax.

## 4. Slash Command Conflicts with MCP Servers

### Issue #703: Slash Command Registration Collision with MCP Server Configuration

**Status:** Fixed in v0.2.64+, but users upgrading from older versions may still experience issues
**Affected Versions:** Pre-0.2.64
**Trigger:** Installing custom slash commands + MCP servers simultaneously

#### The Conflict:

Custom slash commands (`.claude/commands/*.md`) and MCP servers both register tools with the API. When names collide, the Anthropic API rejects the request:

```
Error: API Error 400
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "message": "tools: Tool names must be unique."
  }
}
```

#### How Users Experienced It:

A developer created a custom slash command `/joke`:
1. Works fine initially: `/project:joke` executes successfully
2. Adds MCP server "fetch" to the same project
3. Next invocation of `/joke` triggers the collision error
4. All slash commands stop working until resolved

#### Technical Root Cause:

The two tool registration systems don't properly deduplicate or namespace their identifiers. When both attempt registration simultaneously, the API rejects the request due to duplicate tool names.

#### Current State:

- **Status:** Fixed in v0.2.64
- **Users on older versions:** May still experience this
- **Workaround:** Restart Claude Code to clear tool cache, rename conflicting commands to use unique prefixes (`/my-plugin:joke` instead of `/joke`)

---

## 5. Multiple Installation Detection

### VS Code Extension Auto-Creating Local Installations

**Status:** Ongoing issue
**Affected Platform:** All systems with VS Code
**Related Issues:** #3198, #7734

#### The Problem:

Claude Code can be installed in two ways:
1. **Native installation:** Native binaries, single install location
2. **npm installation:** `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

The VS Code extension automatically creates a local installation at `~/.claude/local/` without user permission, leading to multiple installations:

```
Detection output:
- Global npm install: /usr/local/bin/claude → ~/.local/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code
- Local install: ~/.claude/local/bin/claude
- Native install: /usr/local/bin/claude (system binary)

Result: "Multiple installations detected" warning
Conflict: CLI shows inconsistent information about which version is running
```

#### Impact on Plugin Users:

- **State Duplication:** Each installation maintains separate plugin state
- **Marketplace Sync Failures:** Plugin installations in one location don't appear in another
- **Unpredictable Behavior:** Commands work in one shell but not another

#### User Workaround:

```bash
# Check installations
npm list -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code  # Global
ls -la ~/.claude/local                 # Local
which claude                           # Active binary

# Remove npm global version if not using it
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

## 6. Configuration Persistence Issues

### Plugin Configurations Survive Uninstallation

**Status:** Open issue
**Affected Scenario:** Users reinstalling Claude Code
**Impact:** Clean installation impossible without manual intervention

#### The Problem:

When users perform `npm uninstall -g` and reinstall Claude Code:
1. New installation sees saved configuration from previous install
2. Includes MCPs, plugins, marketplaces from previous state
3. Failed plugin entries from previous install persist
4. Users expecting fresh start get corrupted state

#### Specific Issues Reported:

- MCPs configured in previous installation auto-load in new installation
- Plugin marketplace configurations persist despite uninstallation
- Settings file: `~/.claude/settings.json` not removed during uninstall
- Environment files and config references not cleaned up

#### Configuration File Locations Not Cleaned:

```
~/.claude/settings.json        # PERSISTS after uninstall
~/.claude/local/               # May remain
~/.local/bin/claude            # May remain
~/.local/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/  # May remain
```

#### Impact for Multiple Plugin Installations:

Users attempting to:
1. Clean up corrupted plugin state
2. Switch from one plugin collection to another
3. Troubleshoot plugin conflicts

...cannot achieve a truly clean slate without manually removing these configuration files.

## 7. Failed Installation Cleanup

### No Mechanism to Remove Orphaned Plugins

**Status:** Open issue (#9426 includes this request)
**Affected Scenario:** Any plugin installation failure
**User Impact:** Failed plugins permanently stuck in UI/configuration

#### Specific Problems:

1. **Failed installations leave artifacts:**
   - Partial directory structures remain
   - Configuration entries persist
   - No automatic cleanup on failure

2. **No uninstall capability:**
   - UI provides no way to manually remove failed plugins
   - Marketplace removal doesn't cascade to plugins
   - Plugins from removed marketplace cannot be uninstalled

3. **Accumulation over time:**
   ```
   Install plugin-a from marketplace-x → Success
   Remove marketplace-x
   Plugin-a remains installed and configured
   User cannot remove plugin-a through UI

   Repeat 5-10 times with different plugins
   Settings.json grows with orphaned entries
   Claude Code performance degrades
   ```

#### Requested Features (from Issue #9426):

Users request:
- [ ] Clear UI showing all installed plugins (successful and failed)
- [ ] Ability to remove individual plugins even after marketplace removal
- [ ] Consistent plugin state between CLI and UI
- [ ] Cleanup mechanism for failed installation attempts
- [ ] Proper handling when deleting a marketplace (cascade to plugins)

## 8. Documented Issues & Error Patterns

### Common Error Messages Users Report:

**Error 1: Plugin appears installed but shows in two states**
```
CLI: /plugin list → Shows plugin-name
UI: Plugin Manager → Plugin not visible
Uninstall: /plugin remove plugin-name → "No such plugin"
```

**Error 2: Marketplace won't add**
```
$ /plugin marketplace add user/repo
# Hangs for 5+ minutes...
$ # Process times out or force-quit required
```

**Error 3: Marketplace won't remove**
```
Marketplace removed from UI
On restart: Marketplace reappears
Reason: extraKnownMarketplaces still in settings.json
```

**Error 4: Slash command collision**
```
/my-command works fine
Add MCP server to project
/my-command now returns: "tools: Tool names must be unique"
```

**Error 5: Multiple installations**
```
$ claude doctor
Multiple installations detected:
  - Global: npm version
  - Local: ~/.claude/local
  - System: native binary

Active: Undefined (unclear which is running)
```

## 9. Community Workarounds & Solutions

### What Users Are Doing to Resolve Issues:

**For inconsistent plugin state:**
```bash
# Manual settings.json cleanup
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | python -m json.tool
# Remove problematic entries manually
# Restart Claude Code
```

**For marketplace that won't remove:**
```bash
# Edit settings directly
vim ~/.claude/settings.json
# Find: "extraKnownMarketplaces": [...]
# Delete the marketplace entry
# Save and restart
```

**For corrupted installation:**
```bash
# Complete uninstall and reinstall
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
# Remove config completely
rm -rf ~/.claude/
rm -rf ~/.local/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/
# Reinstall fresh
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**For slash command conflicts:**
```bash
# Rename custom commands to use unique prefixes
# Old: ~/.claude/commands/joke.md
# New: ~/.claude/commands/my-plugin:joke.md
# Restart Claude Code
```

**For multiple installations:**
```bash
# Check which is active
which claude
# Remove the one not being used
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code  # If using native
# Or remove ~/.claude/local if using npm global
```

## 10. Best Practices for Multiple Plugin Installation

### Recommended Safe Approach:

1. **Start minimal:**
   - Install only plugins you actively use
   - Don't install entire marketplaces at once

2. **Test one at a time:**
   - Add marketplace
   - Install single plugin
   - Test functionality
   - Move to next plugin

3. **Monitor state:**
   - After each install: `/plugin list` to verify
   - Check UI to ensure plugin appears
   - Test plugin's slash commands or MCP tools

4. **Maintain backups:**
   ```bash
   # Backup settings before major changes
   cp ~/.claude/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json.backup
   ```

5. **Document your setup:**
   ```json
   {
     "installedPlugins": [
       "plugin-1-name",
       "plugin-2-name"
     ],
     "marketplaces": [
       "user/repo"
     ]
   }
   ```

6. **Avoid problematic combinations:**
   - Don't install multiple marketplaces simultaneously (causes hang)
   - Don't install custom slash commands with same names as MCP tools
   - Don't mix very old and very new plugin versions

7. **Use namespacing for custom commands:**
   ```
   /my-plugin:command-name  # Instead of just /command-name
   Prevents collisions with other plugins or MCP servers
   ```

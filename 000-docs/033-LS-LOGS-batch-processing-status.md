# Agent Skills Batch Processing Status

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** RUNNING (ultra-safe mode with improved prompt)

---

## Recent Improvements

### 1. Prompt Enhancement ‚úÖ
**Updated the generation prompt to teach Gemini about:**
- What Claude Code is (Anthropic's CLI tool)
- What plugins are (extensions that add capabilities)
- What Agent Skills are (instruction manuals for automatic activation)
- How the trigger/activation system works
- The 4-step flow: Discovery ‚Üí Installation ‚Üí Startup ‚Üí Usage

### 2. Rate Limit Increase ‚úÖ
**Changed from 15s ‚Üí 30s between API calls**
- Previous: 15 seconds (still had some quota errors)
- Current: 30 seconds (ultra-conservative, zero errors expected)
- Trade-off: Slower but 100% reliable

### 3. Logic Fix ‚úÖ
**Fixed skip detection:**
- Previous: Checked if `skills/` folder exists (skipped plugins with empty folders)
- Current: Checks if `SKILL.md` file exists (only skips if file present)
- Result: Will regenerate for all previously failed plugins

---

## Current Configuration

### Rate Limiting
- **Delay:** 30 seconds between calls
- **Why:** Eliminates all quota errors completely
- **Trade-off:** Very slow but 100% reliable
- **Estimated time:** 78.5 minutes for 157 priority plugins

### Model
- **Model:** gemini-2.0-flash-exp (experimental)
- **Reason:** Only model accessible in project
- **Issue:** Stable models (gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro) return 404 errors

### Process Details
- **Log File:** /tmp/skills-gen.log
- **Mode:** --priority (157 plugins: devops, security, testing, ai-ml, performance, database)
- **Auto-confirm:** --yes flag (no prompts)
- **Python:** Unbuffered output (-u flag) for real-time logging

---

## Progress Statistics

### Current Stats
```
‚úÖ Success: 66 skills generated
‚ùå Errors: 179 (quota errors from previous runs with lower delays)
üìä Avg Generation Time: 5.2 seconds
üìä Avg Line Count: 51 lines
‚úÖ Validation Pass Rate: 100% (0 validation failures)
```

### Estimated Completion

**With 30-second rate limit:**
- **Time per plugin:** 30s delay + 5.2s generation = ~35 seconds
- **Priority plugins:** 157 total
- **Already successful:** 66 skills
- **Remaining:** ~91 plugins (some have empty folders, will retry)
- **Time remaining:** ~53 minutes

**Total estimated time from restart:** ~1 hour 20 minutes

---

## What's Happening

The script is processing each plugin:

1. **Reads plugin context** (plugin.json, README.md, commands/, agents/)
2. **Checks for existing SKILL.md** (NOT just empty folder)
3. **Generates SKILL.md** via Vertex AI Gemini with improved prompt
4. **Validates** against 8-point quality check
5. **Saves** to `plugins/{name}/skills/skill-adapter/SKILL.md`
6. **Updates keywords** in plugin.json and marketplace.extended.json
7. **Logs** to SQLite database with full backup
8. **Waits 30 seconds** before next plugin

---

## Key Improvements This Session

### Prompt Context (Most Important)
The prompt now teaches Gemini what Claude Code plugins and Agent Skills are:

```
CONTEXT - What You're Creating:

Claude Code is Anthropic's CLI tool for software development.
Users install PLUGINS (extensions) to add capabilities.

AGENT SKILLS are instruction manuals (SKILL.md files) that teach Claude Code:
- WHEN to automatically activate a specific plugin (trigger phrases)
- HOW to use the plugin effectively (workflow steps)
- WHAT the plugin is best used for (examples and scenarios)

When a user says something like "create ansible playbook", Claude Code:
1. Scans installed plugins' SKILL.md frontmatter at startup
2. Matches "ansible playbook" to the trigger terms in a skill's description
3. Reads the full SKILL.md for detailed instructions
4. Automatically activates that plugin with the correct workflow
```

This context should significantly improve the quality of generated skills.

### Rate Limit Optimization
- Started at 10s ‚Üí Hit quota errors
- Tried 15s ‚Üí Still some errors
- Now at 30s ‚Üí Should have zero errors

### Skip Logic Fix
- Previous versions created empty `skills/` folders even on failed generations
- Script would skip these plugins thinking skills were already created
- Fixed to check for actual `SKILL.md` file, not just folder
- Now will regenerate for all previously failed attempts

## Monitoring Commands

### Check Current Progress
```bash
# View live log
tail -f /tmp/skills-gen.log

# View statistics
python3 scripts/vertex-skills-generator-safe.py --stats

# Count generated SKILL.md files
find plugins -name "SKILL.md" -type f | wc -l

# Check database directly
sqlite3 backups/skills-audit/skills_generation.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM skill_generations WHERE status = 'SUCCESS';"
```

### Check Process Status
```bash
# See if it's running
ps aux | grep vertex-skills-generator

# View recent successful generations
sqlite3 backups/skills-audit/skills_generation.db "SELECT plugin_name, char_count, line_count FROM skill_generations WHERE status = 'SUCCESS' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### Check for Errors
```bash
# See error count
sqlite3 backups/skills-audit/skills_generation.db "SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM skill_generations GROUP BY status;"

# View error details
sqlite3 backups/skills-audit/skills_generation.db "SELECT plugin_name, error_message FROM skill_generations WHERE status = 'ERROR' LIMIT 10;"
```

## What You Should Do Now

### 1. Request Quota Increase (Optional - For Future Runs)

**Visit:**
```
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/aiplatform.googleapis.com/quotas?project=ccpi-web-app-prod
```

**Steps:**
1. Search for: "generate_content_requests_per_minute"
2. Find: "Generate content requests per minute per project per base model"
3. Filter by: gemini-experimental
4. Click checkbox ‚Üí "EDIT QUOTAS"
5. Request: **60 requests/minute** (currently ~5-10)
6. Justification:
   ```
   Batch processing Agent Skills for 227 Claude Code plugins.
   Currently limited to 5-10 requests/minute causing frequent 429 errors.
   Need 60 requests/minute (1 per second) for efficient batch processing.

   Use case: Generating SKILL.md instruction manuals that teach Claude Code
   when and how to use each plugin automatically. Each generation takes ~5
   seconds with Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental.

   Estimated processing time with 60 req/min: ~25 minutes total
   Current processing time with 5-10 req/min: ~1.5 hours with 30s delays
   ```
7. Submit request
8. Wait 24-48 hours for approval

```bash
node scripts/sync-marketplace.cjs
```

This updates the CLI marketplace catalog with the new keywords.

### 2. Review Generated Skills
```bash
# View statistics
python3 scripts/vertex-skills-generator-safe.py --stats

# Review a few random samples
find plugins -name "SKILL.md" -newer backups/skills-audit/skills_generation.db | shuf | head -5 | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "=== {} ===" && head -30 {}'

# Check validation failures (should be 0)
sqlite3 backups/skills-audit/skills_generation.db "SELECT * FROM validation_failures;"
```

### 3. Commit Changes
```bash
git status
git diff .claude-plugin/marketplace.extended.json | head -100
git add .
git commit -m "feat(skills): batch generate Agent Skills for priority plugins via Vertex AI

## Current File Structure

Skills are being added to existing plugins:

```
plugins/devops-automation-pack/        ‚Üê Existing plugin
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude-plugin/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin.json                    ‚Üê Updated with "agent-skills" keyword
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ automate.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skills/                            ‚Üê NEW FOLDER
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skill-adapter/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md                   ‚Üê NEW FILE (instruction manual)
```

**NOT creating:** New plugins (229 stays the same)
**IS creating:** SKILL.md files inside existing plugins

## Backup & Recovery

### Database Location
```
backups/skills-audit/skills_generation.db
```

Contains:
- Full backup of every generated SKILL.md
- Timestamp of generation
- Success/error status
- Character count and line count
- Error messages for failed attempts

### Recovery if Needed
```bash
# Export all successful skills
sqlite3 backups/skills-audit/skills_generation.db <<EOF
.mode markdown
.output backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).md
SELECT plugin_name, skill_content FROM skill_generations WHERE status = 'SUCCESS';
EOF
```

### View Backed Up Content
```bash
# See specific plugin's generated skill
sqlite3 backups/skills-audit/skills_generation.db "SELECT skill_content FROM skill_generations WHERE plugin_name = 'devops-automation-pack' AND status = 'SUCCESS';"
```

## Performance Evolution

### Run 1 (10-second delay)
- **Rate:** 6 plugins/minute
- **Result:** 50 successes, 176 quota errors
- **Success rate:** 22%

### Run 2 (15-second delay)
- **Rate:** 4 plugins/minute
- **Result:** 16 additional successes, still had quota errors
- **Success rate:** ~30%

### Current Run (30-second delay + improved prompt)
- **Rate:** 2 plugins/minute
- **Result:** Expected 0 quota errors
- **Success rate:** Expected 100%
- **Trade-off:** 3x slower than run 1, but reliable

### With Quota Increase (60 req/min - future)
- **Rate:** 12 plugins/minute
- **Delay:** 5 seconds
- **Time:** ~13 minutes for 157 plugins
- **Success rate:** 100%

# Claude Code Multiple Plugin Installation Issues - Research Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Research Focus:** Real-world user-reported issues with multiple plugin installations
**Sources:** GitHub issues, official documentation, community discussions
**Time Period:** October 2025 (latest data)

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Most Critical Issue: Plugin Management State Problems (Issue #9426)

**What users report:**
- Cannot remove previously installed plugins
- Plugins appear installed but are not visible in UI
- CLI and UI show contradictory information about plugin status
- No error messages explain what's wrong

**Real example from GitHub:**
> "After removing marketplace X and re-adding it, I installed some plugins. Now I can't uninstall them through the UI. The CLI says they're installed, but when I try to uninstall, it says no plugins are installed."

**User workaround:**
Manual editing of `~/.claude/settings.json` to fix stuck installation states.

---

### 2. Marketplace Removal Doesn't Clean Up (Issue #9537)

**What users experience:**
```
Step 1: Remove marketplace via /plugin menu
Step 2: Marketplace disappears from UI
Step 3: Restart Claude Code
Step 4: Marketplace reappears (user confused)
```

**Why it happens:**
The marketplace entry remains in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `extraKnownMarketplaces`, so Claude automatically reinstalls it on startup.

**For multiple plugins:** Users trying to switch between plugin collections cannot clean up old ones.

---

### 3. Marketplace Installation Hangs (Issue #9297)

**The command that fails:**
```
/plugin marketplace add user/repo
# Hangs indefinitely...
```

**Root cause:**
Uses SSH protocol that fails silently. No error message, no timeout.

**For multiple plugins:** Cannot add new marketplaces, so cannot install from them.

---

### 4. Slash Command Conflicts with MCP Servers (Issue #703)

**Scenario:**
1. User creates custom slash command `/joke` in `.claude/commands/`
2. User adds MCP server to project
3. User tries `/joke` again
4. Gets API error: "tools: Tool names must be unique"

**Technical root cause:** Both systems try to register tools with same names simultaneously, causing API rejection.

**Status:** Fixed in v0.2.64+, but users on older versions still experience it.

---

### 5. Multiple Installations Confusion

**What happens:**
Claude Code can install as:
- Native binary
- npm global package
- Local installation in `~/.claude/local/`

The VS Code extension auto-creates a local installation, resulting in "Multiple installations detected" warnings.

**For multiple plugins:** Each installation maintains separate plugin state, causing unpredictable behavior.

---

### 6. Failed Plugins Permanently Stuck

**User experience:**
1. Install plugin from marketplace
2. Installation fails (network error, permissions, etc.)
3. Failed plugin entry remains in configuration
4. Cannot remove through UI
5. Manual file editing required

**Impact:** Users report failed installations accumulating over time, degrading performance.

---

## Error Messages Users Actually See

```
1. "Plugin available to install" → After install: "Already installed"
   → Try to uninstall: "No plugins installed"

2. Process hangs when doing: /plugin marketplace add

3. After removing marketplace: Reappears on restart

4. "tools: Tool names must be unique" when using slash commands

5. "Multiple installations detected" warnings
```

## Issues Severity Matrix

| Issue | Affects Multiple Plugins | Severity | Status |
|-------|--------------------------|----------|--------|
| Can't remove plugins | YES (core blocker) | HIGH | Open |
| Marketplace removal persists | YES (affects switching) | HIGH | Open |
| Marketplace add hangs | YES (prevents installation) | HIGH | Open |
| Slash command collisions | YES (when mixing types) | MEDIUM | Fixed (v0.2.64+) |
| Multiple installations | YES (state duplication) | MEDIUM | Open |
| Failed installs persist | YES (accumulation) | MEDIUM | Open |

---

## User Workarounds That Actually Work

### For "Can't remove plugin" issue:
```bash
# Edit settings manually
vim ~/.claude/settings.json
# Find and remove the plugin entry
# Restart Claude Code
```

### For "Marketplace won't remove" issue:
```bash
vim ~/.claude/settings.json
# Remove from: "extraKnownMarketplaces": [...]
# Restart
```

### For "Marketplace add hangs" issue:
Use full HTTPS URL instead of GitHub shorthand
```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### For "Multiple installations detected":
```bash
# Check which is active
which claude

# Remove the one not being used
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
# OR remove ~/.claude/local if using native
```

### For corrupted plugin state:
```bash
# Complete clean reinstall
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
rm -rf ~/.claude/ ~/.local/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

## What Anthropic Acknowledges

**From official statements:**
- Plugin system is in **public beta** (October 2025)
- Features and best practices still evolving
- Development team actively monitoring GitHub issues

**Issues officially tracked:**
- #9426: Plugin management (with feature requests for better UI)
- #9537: Marketplace cleanup
- #9297: Marketplace add hang
- #703: Slash command collision (fixed in v0.2.64)

---

## Best Practices for Multiple Plugins

1. **Install one at a time**
   - Add marketplace
   - Install single plugin
   - Test it
   - Move to next

2. **Monitor state after each action**
   - Run `/plugin list` to verify
   - Check UI to see plugin appears
   - Test plugin's functionality

3. **Avoid these combinations:**
   - Don't add multiple marketplaces simultaneously (causes hangs)
   - Don't create custom slash commands with same names as MCP tools
   - Don't rely on old VS Code installations (multiple installations issue)

4. **Backup before major changes:**
   ```bash
   cp ~/.claude/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json.backup
   ```

5. **Use namespacing for custom commands:**
   ```
   /my-plugin:command-name  # Safe
   /command-name             # May conflict with MCP tools
   ```

## Real-World Example: User's Failed Multi-Plugin Setup

### Scenario:
A developer tries to install 5 plugins from 3 different marketplaces:

**What happens:**
1. Adds marketplace A → Works
2. Adds marketplace B → Hangs indefinitely (times out after 10 minutes)
3. Tries again → Still hangs
4. Removes marketplace B from UI
5. But on restart, marketplace B reappears (wasn't truly removed)
6. Tries installing plugin from marketplace B → Already shows installed
7. Cannot uninstall through UI
8. Manual `settings.json` editing required
9. Had to restart Claude
10. Plugin still stuck in failed state

**Time wasted:** 1+ hours of troubleshooting

### With Better System:
1. Add marketplace → Succeeds with error feedback if it fails
2. Install plugin → Clear success/failure message
3. Remove marketplace → Cascade removes all associated plugins
4. All changes reflected immediately in CLI and UI
5. Failed installs automatically cleaned up

## What This Means for the Plugin Marketplace

### Risks for Users Installing from This Repository:

1. **If installing multiple plugins:**
   - Follow "Best Practices for Multiple Plugins" above
   - Test each plugin individually
   - Monitor state with `/plugin list`

2. **If switching between plugin collections:**
   - Manual settings.json cleanup required
   - Cannot rely on UI removal being complete
   - Recommend full restart between major changes

3. **If plugin fails to install:**
   - Likely a known bug, not your plugin's fault
   - Refer to workarounds above
   - Report if it's a reproducible issue

### For Plugin Developers:

1. **Test your plugin in isolation first**
   - Before testing with other plugins
   - Document any known conflicts

2. **Use unique command names**
   - Namespace with plugin name if providing slash commands
   - Prevents conflicts with MCP tools

3. **Document setup instructions**
   - Mention if other plugins should be installed first
   - Note any compatibility requirements

4. **Monitor issue reports**
   - Users will report problems with your plugin
   - May be Claude Code issue, not plugin issue

## Conclusion

Claude Code's plugin system is powerful but has significant rough edges in the **management, cleanup, and lifecycle** of multiple plugins. Most issues can be worked around with manual intervention, but users should:

1. Install plugins carefully (one at a time)
2. Monitor state after each action
3. Backup settings before major changes
4. Be prepared for manual settings.json editing
5. Report reproducible issues to help fix the underlying problems

The development team is actively tracking these issues and working on improvements, but as of October 2025, users should follow the documented workarounds for best results.

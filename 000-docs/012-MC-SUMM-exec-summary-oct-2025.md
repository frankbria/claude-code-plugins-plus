# Executive Summary: Anthropic Updates Research
**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Repository:** claude-code-plugins

---

## Key Findings

### üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY

**Anthropic launched Agent Skills TODAY (October 16, 2025)** - a brand new feature separate from Plugins.

**Opportunity:** First-mover advantage to be the first Claude Code marketplace with comprehensive Skills support.

---

## What Are Skills?

**Skills** are model-invoked capabilities that Claude automatically uses when relevant (different from user-invoked slash commands).

**Key Difference:**
- **Plugins** = Distribution mechanism (users install)
- **Skills** = Capabilities (Claude auto-invokes)
- **Commands** = Explicit triggers (users type `/command`)

**Example:**
- Skill: Claude automatically formats Excel when you mention spreadsheets
- Command: You type `/format-excel` to explicitly trigger formatting

---

## Current Repository Status

### ‚úÖ What We Have
- 226 plugins across 14 categories
- Comprehensive marketplace system
- Updated CLAUDE.md (today)
- Robust CI/CD pipeline
- Security scanning

### ‚ùå What We're Missing
- Skills support (launched today!)
- Skills documentation
- Skills examples
- Skills templates
- Skills vs Plugins comparison

---

## Critical Updates Needed (This Week)

### Priority 1: Documentation

1. **Update CLAUDE.md** with Skills section
2. **Update README.md** with Skills vs Plugins explanation
3. **Add security warning** about code execution to USER_SECURITY_GUIDE.md

### Priority 2: Examples

4. **Create Skills demo plugin** (`examples/skills-demo/`)
5. **Update all 4 templates** with `skills/` directory

## Security Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Skills can execute code** through Claude's Code Execution Tool.

**Implications:**
- Untrusted skills can harm your system
- Only use skills from trusted sources
- Review all SKILL.md files before use
- Prefer skills with restricted `allowed-tools`

---

## Best Practices Updates (2025)

### New Recommendations from Anthropic:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Create at repo root as "project README for agents" ‚úÖ Done
2. **Plan before coding** - Ask Claude to plan, don't code until confirmed
3. **Small commits** - Frequent commits, never massive diffs
4. **Start read-only** - Use Read/Grep first, writes only after understanding
5. **Team standardization** - Use `.claude/settings.json` for consistent plugins

### Our Compliance:

| Best Practice | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| CLAUDE.md at root | ‚úÖ Implemented today |
| Semantic versioning | ‚úÖ All plugins |
| Comprehensive README | ‚úÖ Every plugin |
| Security scanning | ‚úÖ CI checks |
| Team configuration | ‚ö†Ô∏è Could add examples |
| **Skills support** | ‚ùå **MISSING** |

## 📱 REDDIT ANNOUNCEMENT

### r/ClaudeAI

**Title:** [Update] Skill Enhancers + Monetization - Plugins that automate Claude's Skills

```
Hey r/ClaudeAI!

I just launched a major update to my Claude Code marketplace:

## What's New

**Skill Enhancers** - a new plugin category that extends Claude's built-in Skills with automation.

**The Pattern:**
1. Claude's Skill finds information (web_search, read_file, calendar)
2. Plugin automates the action (create ticket, deploy code, send notification)
3. You save hours of manual work

## First Plugin: web-to-github-issue (FREE)

Example: "research PostgreSQL indexing best practices and create a ticket"

- Claude uses web_search Skill → finds 5 sources
- Plugin parses findings → extracts key points
- GitHub issue created → formatted with sources

**Install:** `/plugin install web-to-github-issue@claude-code-plugins-plus`

## Monetization (GitHub Sponsors)

All 228 plugins remain free and open source. New sponsor tiers for:

- **Supporter ($5/mo):** Early access, Discord
- **Pro ($19/mo):** Premium Skill Enhancers (4 coming Q1), priority support
- **Enterprise ($199/mo):** Custom development, dedicated support

## Premium Plugin Roadmap (Q1 2025)

- **search-to-slack** (Pro) - Research → Slack digests
- **file-to-code** (Pro) - Requirements → Production code
- **calendar-to-workflow** (Pro) - Meeting automation
- **research-to-deploy** (Enterprise) - Infrastructure automation

## Links

- **Marketplace:** https://claudecodeplugins.io/skill-enhancers
- **Sponsor:** https://github.com/sponsors/jeremylongshore
- **Docs:** https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins/blob/main/docs/sponsor/README.md

## Feedback?

This is a new revenue model for open source Claude plugins. What do you think about the tier pricing? Is $19/mo fair for premium automation plugins?

Let me know if you have questions!
```

## 💼 LINKEDIN ANNOUNCEMENT

```
🚀 Excited to announce: Skill Enhancers for Claude Code

After building 228 free, open-source Claude Code plugins, I'm introducing a new category that changes how we use AI:

**Skill Enhancers** - Plugins that extend Claude's built-in Skills with automation.

Example workflow:
→ Ask Claude: "research PostgreSQL indexing and create a ticket"
→ Claude uses web_search Skill (finds 5 authoritative sources)
→ My plugin creates formatted GitHub issue with findings
→ What used to take 15 minutes now takes 30 seconds

## Sustainable Open Source

All plugins remain free. New GitHub Sponsors tiers:

🌟 Supporter ($5/mo) - Early access
💎 Pro ($19/mo) - Premium plugins + priority support
🏢 Enterprise ($199/mo) - Custom development + dedicated support

## Premium Roadmap (Q1 2025)

- search-to-slack: Research → Team updates
- file-to-code: Requirements → Production code
- calendar-to-workflow: Meeting automation
- research-to-deploy: Infrastructure deployment

This represents a new revenue model for AI tooling - keep the core free, charge for advanced automation.

Thoughts? Is $19/mo fair for enterprise-grade automation plugins?

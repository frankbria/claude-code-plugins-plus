## 🆕 What's New

### **Skills Powerkit** - The Ultimate Meta-Plugin

We're introducing **Skills Powerkit**, a revolutionary plugin that manages OTHER plugins through natural language automation!

**What Makes It Special:**

- 🎯 **First Skills-based plugin** - Uses Anthropic's Agent Skills for model-invoked automation
- 🛠️ **First meta-plugin** - A plugin specifically designed to create, validate, audit, and manage other plugins
- 🧠 **Repository-specific** - Understands the two-catalog system, CLAUDE.md standards, and marketplace workflow
- 💬 **Natural language interface** - Just say "create a plugin" or "validate this plugin" and it works automatically
- ⚡ **Massive time savings** - Reduces plugin lifecycle management from **40-60 minutes to 1-2 minutes**!

   - **Say:** "validate this plugin" or "is my plugin ready to commit?"

3. **📦 Marketplace Manager**
   - Updates marketplace catalogs
   - Runs sync scripts automatically
   - Checks for duplicates
   - **Say:** "add to marketplace" or "sync catalog"

4. **🔍 Plugin Auditor**
   - Scans for hardcoded secrets
   - Checks dangerous commands
   - Validates best practices
   - **Say:** "audit plugin" or "security review"

5. **🔢 Version Bumper**
   - Handles semantic versioning
   - Updates all relevant files
   - Creates git tags
   - **Say:** "bump version to 1.2.0" or "release"

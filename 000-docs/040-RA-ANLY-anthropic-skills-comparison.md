# Anthropic Agent Skills vs Claude Code Plugins - Comprehensive Comparison

**Date Created:** 2025-10-19
**Repository Analyzed:** https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git
**Comparison Scope:** Agent Skills architecture, composition, and best practices

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the official Anthropic Agent Skills repository, our claude-code-plugins approach is **structurally sound but could be significantly enhanced** with better content depth, bundled resources, and skill composition patterns. Anthropic follows a "progressive disclosure" model with rich bundled resources, while we're currently creating lightweight instruction-only skills.

### Key Findings

‚úÖ **What We're Doing Right:**
- Correct YAML frontmatter structure
- Valid skill naming conventions
- Proper directory organization (`skills/skill-adapter/SKILL.md`)
- Good trigger phrase inclusion in descriptions
- Integration with broader plugin ecosystem

‚ö†Ô∏è **Areas for Improvement:**
- Missing bundled resources (scripts, references, assets)
- Lighter instructional content compared to Anthropic examples
- No progressive disclosure patterns
- Limited executable utilities
- Could add more detailed workflows and examples

## Structural Comparison

### 1. Directory Structure

#### Anthropic's Approach
```
skill-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md                    # Required entrypoint
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.txt                 # License file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                    # Executable utilities (Python/Bash)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init_skill.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package_skill.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ quick_validate.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ references/                 # Documentation loaded as needed
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp_best_practices.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python_mcp_server.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api_docs.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                     # Output resources (templates, images)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fonts/
```

#### Our Current Approach
```
plugin-name/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skills/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skill-adapter/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md            # Only file (lightweight)
```

**Analysis:** We're using the minimal valid structure, but missing the richness of bundled resources that make Anthropic's skills more powerful.

### 2. SKILL.md Frontmatter

#### Anthropic's Required Fields
```yaml
---
name: skill-name                # Required (lowercase, hyphens)
description: |                  # Required (multi-line, detailed)
  What the skill does and when Claude should use it.
  Includes trigger phrases and use cases.
license: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt  # Optional
allowed-tools: [Read, Write]   # Optional (Claude Code only)
metadata:                       # Optional (custom key-value pairs)
  author: "Name"
  version: "1.0.0"
---
```

#### Our Current Approach
```yaml
---
name: Skill Display Name        # ‚ö†Ô∏è Should be hyphen-case
description: |                  # ‚úÖ Good - includes triggers
  Multi-line description with trigger phrases.
---
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ We have required fields (`name`, `description`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Our `name` field sometimes uses title case instead of hyphen-case
- ‚ùå We're not leveraging optional fields like `allowed-tools` or `metadata`
- ‚úÖ Our descriptions include trigger phrases (good practice)

### 3. Content Structure & Writing Style

#### Anthropic's Pattern

From `skill-creator/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: skill-creator
description: Guide for creating effective skills...
---

# Skill Creator

## About Skills
[Conceptual overview]

## Skill Creation Process

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples
[Detailed workflow instructions]

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents
[Implementation guidance]

## Behavioral Guidelines

- Write "To accomplish X, do Y" not "You should..."
- Objective, instructional language
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Hierarchical structure** with clear sections
- **Process-oriented** (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- **Imperative/infinitive verb form** throughout
- **Rich examples** with code blocks
- **Comprehensive workflows** (not just descriptions)

#### Our Current Pattern

From `web-to-github-issue/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: Creating GitHub Issues from Web Research
description: |
  This skill enhances Claude's ability...
---

## Overview
[Brief explanation]

## How It Works
1. Web Search
2. Information Extraction
3. GitHub Issue Creation

### Example 1: Researching Security Best Practices
[Scenario description]
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Good structure (Overview, How It Works, Examples)
- ‚úÖ Clear trigger conditions
- ‚úÖ Practical examples
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lighter on procedural depth
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No bundled resources referenced
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some second-person language ("you")

---

## Deep Dive: Content Quality

### Anthropic Example: `mcp-builder` Skill

**File Size:** 13,552 bytes
**Structure:**
- 4-phase workflow (Deep Research ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Initialization ‚Üí Editing)
- Multiple reference files loaded via WebFetch
- Bundled initialization scripts
- Comprehensive error handling guidance
- Real code examples throughout

**Key Content Elements:**
1. **Agent-Centric Design Principles** section
2. **Exhaustive API documentation study** instructions
3. **Implementation plan** templates
4. **Reference to bundled utilities** (`scripts/init_skill.py`)
5. **Progressive disclosure** instructions (when to load references)

### Our Example: `web-to-github-issue` Skill

**File Size:** ~1,600 bytes
**Structure:**
- Overview ‚Üí How It Works ‚Üí When to Use ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí Best Practices
- No bundled resources
- No executable scripts
- Focus on high-level description

**Key Content Elements:**
1. Clear trigger phrases ‚úÖ
2. Workflow steps (but high-level)
3. Examples with scenarios
4. Best practices section

**Gap Analysis:**
- ‚ùå No bundled scripts for common operations
- ‚ùå No reference documentation files
- ‚ùå Limited procedural depth
- ‚ùå No progressive disclosure patterns
- ‚úÖ Good at describing *what* the skill does
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaker at prescribing *how* Claude should do it

---

## Progressive Disclosure Model

### Anthropic's Three-Level Loading System

1. **Level 1: Metadata (Always Loaded)**
   - `name` and `description` fields (~100 words)
   - Used for skill discovery and triggering
   - Always in context window

2. **Level 2: SKILL.md Body (Loaded When Triggered)**
   - Full markdown content (<5k words guideline)
   - Procedural instructions
   - References to bundled resources
   - Loaded when skill activates

3. **Level 3: Bundled Resources (Loaded As Needed)**
   - `scripts/` - May execute without loading to context
   - `references/` - Loaded when Claude determines needed
   - `assets/` - Used in output, not loaded to context
   - Unlimited total size

**Example from `mcp-builder`:**
```markdown
#### 1.4 Study Framework Documentation

**Load and read the following reference files:**

- **MCP Best Practices**: [üìã View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md)
- **Python SDK Documentation**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`
```

**Our Current Approach:**
- ‚úÖ We use Level 1 (metadata) correctly
- ‚úÖ We use Level 2 (SKILL.md content) correctly
- ‚ùå We rarely use Level 3 (bundled resources)

---

## Bundled Resources Analysis

### Anthropic's Resource Types

#### 1. Scripts Directory (`scripts/`)
**Purpose:** Executable utilities for deterministic operations

**Examples from `skill-creator`:**
- `init_skill.py` - Generates new skill templates
- `package_skill.py` - Validates and packages skills into ZIP
- `quick_validate.py` - Fast validation checks

**When to use:**
- Code that's rewritten repeatedly
- Deterministic reliability needed
- Token-efficient execution (runs without loading)

**Benefits:**
- Saves tokens by executing directly
- Ensures consistency across invocations
- Provides reliable automation

#### 2. References Directory (`references/`)
**Purpose:** Documentation loaded into context as needed

**Examples from `mcp-builder`:**
- `reference/mcp_best_practices.md` - Core MCP guidelines
- `reference/python_mcp_server.md` - Python-specific patterns
- `reference/node_mcp_server.md` - TypeScript patterns

**When to use:**
- Database schemas
- API documentation
- Domain knowledge
- Company policies
- Detailed workflow guides

**Best practices:**
- Keep SKILL.md lean, move details to references
- Include grep search patterns if files are large (>10k words)
- Avoid duplication between SKILL.md and references

#### 3. Assets Directory (`assets/`)
**Purpose:** Files used in skill output (not loaded to context)

**Examples from `slack-gif-creator`:**
- `templates/` - Animation templates
- `core/` - Python modules for GIF building

**When to use:**
- Templates (HTML, React, documents)
- Images, icons, fonts
- Boilerplate code
- Sample documents

**Benefits:**
- Separates output resources from documentation
- Enables file usage without context loading
- Supports rich skill capabilities

---

### Our Current State

**Bundled Resources Usage:** Minimal to none in most skills

**Opportunities:**
1. **Scripts we could add:**
   - Issue creation automation (for `web-to-github-issue`)
   - Commit message validation (for `devops-automation-pack`)
   - Security scanning utilities

2. **References we could add:**
   - API documentation for integrated services
   - Best practices guides
   - Schema definitions

3. **Assets we could add:**
   - Template files for generated outputs
   - Configuration templates
   - Example data structures

## Packaging & Distribution

### Anthropic's Marketplace Structure

```json
{
  "name": "anthropic-agent-skills",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Keith Lazuka",
    "email": "klazuka@anthropic.com"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Anthropic example skills",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "document-skills",
      "description": "Collection of document processing suite...",
      "source": "./",
      "strict": false,
      "skills": [
        "./document-skills/xlsx",
        "./document-skills/docx",
        "./document-skills/pptx",
        "./document-skills/pdf"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "example-skills",
      "description": "Collection of example skills...",
      "source": "./",
      "strict": false,
      "skills": [
        "./skill-creator",
        "./mcp-builder",
        "./canvas-design",
        // ... more skills
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Observations:**
- ‚úÖ Groups related skills into plugin bundles
- ‚úÖ Uses `skills` array to list individual skill directories
- ‚úÖ Each skill is self-contained directory with SKILL.md
- ‚úÖ `strict: false` allows flexible skill loading

### Our Current Structure

We package skills differently:
- Skills live in `plugins/{category}/{plugin-name}/skills/skill-adapter/`
- Each plugin can have multiple components (commands, agents, skills, MCP)
- Skills are bundled with broader plugin functionality

**Comparison:**
- ‚úÖ Our approach supports richer plugin ecosystems (Skills + Commands + Agents + MCP)
- ‚úÖ We support multi-component plugins
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Anthropic's approach is more focused on pure skill distribution
- ‚úÖ Both approaches are valid for different use cases

---

## Writing Style Analysis

### Anthropic's Style Guide

From `skill-creator` documentation:

**Rule:** Use **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "To accomplish X, do Y"
- ‚úÖ "Load and read the following reference files"
- ‚úÖ "Create a comprehensive implementation plan"
- ‚ùå "You should do X"
- ‚ùå "If you need to do X"

**Rationale:**
- Maintains consistency for AI consumption
- Objective, instructional tone
- Clear, actionable directives

### Our Current Style

Mixed approach:
- Some skills use imperative form
- Some use descriptive/explanatory style
- Some include "you" language

**Example from our skills:**
```markdown
## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Second person
- Create a commit message after making code changes.
```

**Should be:**
```markdown
## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when:  # ‚úÖ Objective
- Creating a commit message after making code changes.
- Ensuring commit messages follow conventional commits standard.
```

### 1. Immediate Improvements (Low Effort, High Impact)

#### Fix Naming Convention
```yaml
# Current (some skills):
name: Creating GitHub Issues from Web Research

# Should be:
name: github-issue-creator
```

#### Adopt Imperative Style
```markdown
# Current:
This skill activates when you need to...

# Should be:
This skill activates when:
- Creating GitHub issues from research
- Tracking security vulnerabilities
```

#### Expand Procedural Content
Add "How to Use This Skill" sections with step-by-step workflows:
```markdown
## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information
To begin research, use WebSearch tool to...

### Step 2: Extract Key Findings
Analyze search results to identify...

### Step 3: Structure the Issue
Format findings into GitHub issue with...
```

---

### 2. Medium-Term Enhancements (Moderate Effort)

#### Add Bundled Scripts

**For `web-to-github-issue`:**
```bash
plugins/skill-enhancers/web-to-github-issue/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skills/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skill-adapter/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create_issue.py          # GitHub API automation
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extract_findings.py      # Web content extraction
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validate_issue.py        # Issue format validation
```

**Update SKILL.md to reference scripts:**
```markdown
## Using Bundled Utilities

To create a GitHub issue programmatically:

```bash
./scripts/create_issue.py \
  --repo "owner/repo" \
  --title "Issue title" \
  --body "Issue body" \
  --labels "bug,security"
```
```

#### Add Reference Documentation

**For plugins with complex domains:**
```bash
plugins/packages/ai-ml-engineering-pack/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skills/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ skill-adapter/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md

- [Best Practices Guide](./references/best_practices.md)
```

---

### 3. Long-Term Strategic Changes (High Effort)

#### Implement Progressive Disclosure

Restructure skills to use three-level loading:

**Level 1 - Metadata (Always Loaded):**
```yaml
---
name: database-optimizer
description: |
  Comprehensive database optimization skill for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.
  Activates when optimizing queries, designing schemas, or troubleshooting performance.
  Includes bundled utilities for EXPLAIN analysis and index recommendations.
---
```

**Level 2 - SKILL.md (Loaded When Triggered):**
```markdown
# Database Optimizer

## Quick Start
[High-level workflow]

## For Detailed Information
- Query optimization: Load `./references/query_optimization.md`
- Schema design: Load `./references/schema_patterns.md`
- Performance tuning: Load `./references/performance_guide.md`
```

**Level 3 - Bundled Resources (Loaded As Needed):**
```
database-optimizer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyze_explain.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ suggest_indexes.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ references/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ query_optimization.md      (10k words)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schema_patterns.md         (8k words)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ performance_guide.md       (12k words)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_queries/
```

#### Create Skill Automation Tooling

Build our own versions of Anthropic's scripts:

**`scripts/init-skill-enhanced.py`:**
```python
"""
Enhanced skill initialization with bundled resource scaffolding.

Usage:
  python scripts/init-skill-enhanced.py \
    --name database-optimizer \
    --category performance \
    --with-scripts \
    --with-references \
    --with-assets
"""
```

**Features:**
- Generate skill directory structure
- Create SKILL.md template with best practices
- Scaffold `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` directories
- Add example files in each directory
- Validate against Anthropic's spec

**`scripts/validate-skill-anthropic-spec.py`:**
```python
"""
Validate skills against Anthropic's Agent Skills Spec v1.0.

Checks:
- YAML frontmatter format
- Required fields (name, description)
- Name convention (lowercase, hyphens)
- Description quality (length, trigger phrases)
- File organization
- Bundled resource references
"""
```

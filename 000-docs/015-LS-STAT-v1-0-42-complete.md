## üí° Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Public repo stays free:** All community plugins remain in public claude-code-plugins-plus repo

- **Dual catalog system:** marketplace.extended.json (source) ‚Üí marketplace.json (generated)

### Pricing Decisions
- **Supporter ($5/mo):** Entry-level tier for individual devs
- **Pro ($19/mo):** Sweet spot for professional devs (10x value proposition)
- **Enterprise ($199/mo):** Custom development tier for companies
- **DiagnosticPro reference:** Corrected to $4.99 (not $29.99)

### Feature Decisions
- **Start with web-to-github-issue:** Flagship free plugin shows value
- **4 premium plugins planned:** Balanced roadmap across tiers
- **Q1 2025 timeline:** Realistic development schedule
- **Discord community:** Central to sponsor engagement

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Mega prompt integration:** Clear requirements led to fast implementation

4. **Version bumping:** Clear progression (1.0.40 ‚Üí 1.0.41 ‚Üí 1.0.42)

### What to Improve

### User Feedback Integrated

- ‚úÖ "keep going dont stop" - continuous implementation
- ‚úÖ Revenue strategy across all products

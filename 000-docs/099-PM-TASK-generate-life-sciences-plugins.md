# Life Sciences Plugin Generation - Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Purpose:** Generate production-grade life sciences MCP plugins using Vertex AI Gemini
**Goal:** Build BETTER life sciences tools than Anthropic's announcement
**Status:** Ready to Execute

---

## Mission: Be Better, Not Competitive

We're not trying to "beat" Anthropic. We're building **genuinely better tools** that researchers will actually want to use because they're:

1. **More accessible** - Free, open-source, easy to install
2. **More powerful** - Complete workflows, not single-purpose tools
3. **More flexible** - Researchers can customize for their needs
4. **More integrated** - Multiple platforms in cohesive packs
5. **Better documented** - Real examples that actually work
6. **Community-driven** - Researchers help build what they need

## Vertex AI Generation Strategy

### Why This Will Work

**Gemini 2.5 Flash Strengths:**
- Large context window (1M tokens) - Can see entire codebase examples
- Fast generation (< 2s typical) - Rapid iteration
- Free tier (1,500 req/day) - Cost-effective at scale
- Code-focused - Trained on GitHub, understands patterns
- Structured output - JSON, TypeScript, Markdown generation

**Our Advantage:**
- We have 5 existing MCP plugins as templates
- We have 164 plugins with Agent Skills as examples
- We have comprehensive API research (document 098)
- We have detailed blueprints (document 082)

### Generation Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Prepare generation prompt (combines docs 082 + 098)
cat 000-docs/082-RL-PROP-life-sciences-plugins.md \
    000-docs/098-RA-ANLY-life-sciences-mcp-research-2025-10-20.md \
    > /tmp/life-sciences-generation-prompt.md

# Step 2: Generate Pack #1 with Vertex AI
python3 << 'EOF'
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel

vertexai.init(project="your-project-id", location="us-central1")
model = GenerativeModel("gemini-2.5-flash-latest")

with open("/tmp/life-sciences-generation-prompt.md") as f:
    base_prompt = f.read()

# Add specific pack instructions
pack_prompt = f"""
{base_prompt}

Generate Pack #1: PubMed Research Master

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Complete TypeScript MCP server with 10 tools
2. 4 Agent Skills (8,000+ bytes each)
3. 5 slash commands with YAML frontmatter
4. 2 specialized agents for complex workflows
5. Comprehensive README with real examples
6. All files production-ready, not skeleton code

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each file, output:
---FILE: path/to/file.ext
[file contents]
---END FILE

Start with: plugins/life-sciences/pubmed-research-master/
"""

response = model.generate_content(pack_prompt)
print(response.text)
EOF

# Step 3: Parse output and create files
python3 scripts/parse-generated-plugin.py \
    --input /tmp/vertex-output.txt \
    --output-dir plugins/life-sciences/pubmed-research-master/

# Step 4: Build and validate
cd plugins/life-sciences/pubmed-research-master/
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test

# Step 5: Test locally
/plugin marketplace add ~/000-projects/claude-code-plugins
/plugin install pubmed-research-master@claude-code-plugins-plus
/pubmed-search "CRISPR gene editing 2024"

# Step 6: If successful, deploy to marketplace
```

**Mitigation:**
- Implement proper rate limiting
- SQLite caching for offline use
- Clear error messages when limits hit
- Configurable retry logic

### Risk: Complexity Overwhelms Users
**Concern:** Too many tools, confusing to researchers
**Mitigation:**

Hey community!

Major release today with two big updates that change how we think about Claude Code plugins:

## 1. Skill Enhancers Category 🎯

A new category that extends Claude's built-in Skills with automation. Here's the pattern:

```
Claude's Skill (finds info) → Plugin (automates action) → Real result
```

### Available Now (FREE)

**[web-to-github-issue](https://claudecodeplugins.io/skill-enhancers/web-to-github-issue)**

Example: _"research PostgreSQL indexing best practices and create a ticket"_

- Claude uses `web_search` Skill → finds 5 authoritative sources
- Plugin parses findings → extracts key points + priority
- GitHub issue created → formatted with sources, labels, next steps

**What used to take 15 minutes now takes 30 seconds.**

**Install:**
```bash
/plugin install web-to-github-issue@claude-code-plugins-plus
```

### Coming Q1 2025 (Pro/Enterprise Tiers)

**Pro Tier ($19/mo):**
1. **search-to-slack** - Research → Slack team digests
2. **file-to-code** - Requirements → Production code
3. **calendar-to-workflow** - Meeting automation

**Enterprise Tier ($199/mo):**
4. **research-to-deploy** - Infrastructure automation
